# Final Phantasy
Full stack web adventure created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySql, Sequelize, Handlebars, Express, Node, jQuery, and Anime.js. 

I was initially assigned to the backend, but after getting the routes running I swapped over to the front end to help out my groupmates and just get the MVP down. I did most of the CSS, had to redo the whole stage 1/Boss HTML, and completed nearly all the JavaScript involved in this project by presentation day. I couldn't stand having this project so close to complete, so I completed the rest of the project and logged it below.

# My extra work after presentation day:  

Stage 1, Accounts, and the Boss stage was incomplete during presentation day, just to see how much progress was made I left this app running: https://fin-phantasy.herokuapp.com/. 

You can see that you're immediately assigned someone else's stats and the stage1 / boss doesn't work at all. I wanted to take a crack at this part before presentation day, but didn't want to take over and take my teammate's chance to learn.

Overall, it didn't matter if I completed it or not; I just wanted to learn and wanted a challenge. I also couldn't bear knowing that I left a project at 75% and didn't complete it.
