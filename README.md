# My extra work after presentation day:  

Stage 1, Accounts, and the Boss stage was incomplete during presentation day, just to see how much progress was made I left this app running: https://fin-phantasy.herokuapp.com/. 

You can see that you're immediately assigned someone else's stats and the stage1 / boss doesn't work at all. I wanted to take a crack at this part before presentation day, but didn't want to take over and take my teammate's chance to learn.

Overall, it didn't matter if I completed it or not; I just wanted to learn and wanted a challenge. I also couldn't bear knowing that I left a project at 75% and didn't complete it.
